 *  Compilation:  javac Vector.java

 *
 *  Implementation of a vector of real numbers.
 *
 *  This class is implemented to be immutable: once the client program
 *  initialize a Vector, it cannot change any of its fields
 *  (N or data[i]) either directly or indirectly. Immutability is a
 *  very desirable feature of a data type.
 *
 *  % java Vector
 *     x     = [ 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 ]
 *     y     = [ 5.0 2.0 4.0 1.0 ]
 *     z     = [ 6.0 4.0 7.0 5.0 ]
 *   10z     = [ 60.0 40.0 70.0 50.0 ]
 *    |x|    = 5.477225575051661
 *   <x, y>  = 25.0

 *
 *  Note that Vector is also the name of an unrelated Java library class.
